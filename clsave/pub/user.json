		This is the sort of place you set up your 'profile' and whatnot.
		It can be read by all mods, but not writeable by any.
		
		By the way, don't store anything important in this comment.
		It is possible that a hacked server might be able to read it.
		
		READ THIS FILE: docs/setup_json.txt
		
		For name, and many other things, you need quotes:
			''name'': ''your name goes here'',
		NOT:
			''name'': this is wrong,
		
		(replace '' with the double-quotes used to contain this comment)
		
		For more info on the syntax itself, see http://json.org/
