work in progress

libraries are "client" and "server"
stuff in both is also put in "common"
note, behaviour might be subtly different

all files must use "/" as a path separator (Unix Master Race)
valid characters are listed here (ignoring the path separator):
-.0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
anything else is invalid and will just be outright rejected

furthermore, no paths will be accepted where a . follows a /
this means that hidden files on unixlikes will not be accepted!

files that are meant to be intercepted should be prefixed with a *
e.g. "*thismap"

maximum path length is 128

stuff that's actually implemented will be marked with an @

lua base library stuff:
	math.* @
	string.* @
	pcall @
	error @
	print @
	loadstring @
	loadfile @
	dofile @
	_G @
	
	nothing else yet
	(TODO: work out what we want to keep,
	 as there's stuff being used that isn't listed here!)
	
	check http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ for more info on these
	
	some notes:
	- dofile(x) = loadfile(x)()
	- loadfile(x) = common.fetch_block("lua", x)
	- common.fetch_block(ftype, x) =
	    local obj = common.fetch_start(ftype, x)
	    if obj ~= true then return obj end
	    while true do
	      local obj = common.fetch_poll()
	      if obj ~= false then return obj end
	      yield()
	    end
	- just about every "load" function is based on common.fetch_block

common.base_dir @
	current base directory (minus the "pkg/" bit)
	
	writing to this string will *not* change the base dir,
	so *don't write to it* or else you'll just screw up your own code!

common.version = {cmp={w,x,y,a,z},num,str="w.x.ya-z"} @
	current engine version
	
	cmp is for the individual version components
	num is a comparable number (bit count for each: 5,5,7,5,10)
	str is the version as a string

client/server.hook_tick = fn(sec_curtime, sec_delta)->sec_wait @
	sets a hook called every "tick"
	returns a number telling it how long it wants to wait for
	
	"sec_curtime" is the current time elapsed from the start
	"sec_delta" is the time elapsed from the start of the last
	call to the hooked function
	
	setting this to nil will quit your game
	
	NOTE: DO NOT USE COMMON FOR THIS HOOK!
	(only client/server is accepted)

server.hook_file = fn(sockfd, ftype, fname)->object
	sets a hook to intercept networked file requests
	
	"sockfd" is the socket pertaining to the file request
	
	can return nil to cancel the request
	can return true to perform the default request
	otherwise, return an object to be serialised
	
	currently supported values for ftype:
	- "icemap"
	
	the rest must be either nil or true.

client.hook_render = fn() @
	sets a hook called every frame
	
	this is the only place where it is safe to render stuff
	such as models and HUDs and whatnot

client.hook_key = fn(key, state, modif, uni) @
	sets a hook called every time a key changes
	
	state is either true or false
	uni is an index of a unicode character, which is 0 if there is no unicode decoding

client.hook_mouse_button = fn(button, state) @
	sets a hook called every time a mouse button changes
	
	state is either true or false

client.hook_mouse_motion = fn(x, y, dx, dy) @
	sets a hook called every time the mouse is moved
	
	x, y are the current position
	dx, dy are the delta positions
	
	you will probably use the latter pair if the mouse is "locked"
	as x, y are not defined the same on all platforms!

server.hook_connect = fn(sockfd, addrinfo) @
	sets a hook called every time a client connects
	
	note, sockfd == true for "local multiplayer" mode
	
	"addrinfo" is a table which may or may not contain:
	- "proto" / "addr": protocol / address used, one of the following:
	  - "local" / nil
	  - "tcp/ip" or "tcp/ip6" / {
	    ["ip"] = address,
	    ["host"] = hostname or nil,
	    ["cport"] = client port,
	    ["sport"] = server port,
	  }
	
	note, not all of the features are supported.

server.hook_disconnect = fn(sockfd, server_force, reason) @
	sets a hook called every time a client disconnects
	
	"server_force" is true where the server forces the disconnect

client.mouse_lock_set(state) @
	locks / unlocks the mouse depending on "state"

client.mouse_visible_set(state) @
	shows / hides the mouse depending on "state"

client.mouse_warp(x, y) @
	moves the mouse to x,y

obj = common.fetch_start(ftype, fname)
	initiates a file fetch
	
	"ftype" is one of the following:
	- "lua": lua script
	- "map": map (autodetect)
	- "icemap": map (icemap) - in-memory maps are serialised as THIS.
	- "vxl": map (vxl) - CANNOT SAVE IN THIS FORMAT.
	- "pmf": pmf model
	- "tga": tga image
	- "json": json data
	- "log": log data (TODO)
	- "wav": wav sound (TODO)
	
	for the server, this just loads the file from the disk.
	
	for the client, all clsave/* stuff is taken from the disk,
	but all other files are downloaded from the server.
	
	returns true if the fetch has started,
	nil if there is an error,
	or the object if this was an immediate load.
	
	if there is already a file in the queue,
	this will return "nil".

obj, csize, usize, amount = common.fetch_poll()
	polls the 
	"obj" is one of the following:
	- "nil" if transfer aborted or nothing is being fetched
	  - in this case, all other fields will be nil
	- "false" if still downloading
	- the object you requested
	  - in this case, another poll will just return nils
	
	"amount" is in the range 0 <= "amount" <= 1,
	and indicates how much is downloaded
	"csize" is the compressed size of the file
	"usize" is the uncompressed size
	
	the two sizes will be nil while unknown.
	
	note, all vxl maps will be converted to icemap before sending.

obj = common.fetch_block(ftype, fname) @
	fetches a file using common.fetch_*
	
	simply returns "nil" on error
	
	if there is already something being fetched,
	it will return "nil", too

map = common.map_load(fname, fmt = "auto") @
	loads a map, either "vxl" or "icemap"
	use "auto" to autodetect
	
	this will return nil if it fails.

map = common.map_new(lx, ly, lz) @
	creates a new map
	
	note, ly is the *height* of the new map
	
	also all dimensions must be powers of two,
	otherwise this will fail horribly!
	
	this will throw a lua error if it fails.

common.map_free(map) @
	free the given map
	if you don't do this then it's memoryleaktopia
	(plus i'm allowed to kill you)
	
	ALSO DON'T DO THIS TO THE CURRENT "SET" MAP
	
	TODO: clean up all models on game kill

common.map_set(map) @

	sets the "current" map
	may return "nil"

common.map_save(map, fname, fmt = "icemap") @

	this will throw a lua error if it fails.

r, g, b, dist = client.map_fog_get() @
	gets the current fog colour / distance

client.map_fog_set(r, g, b, dist) @
	sets the current fog colour / distance

lx, ly, lz = common.map_get_dims() @
	gets the map's dimensions
	
	these will be nil if there is no map loaded

table = common.map_pillar_get(px, pz) @
	returns a full pillar of data, skipping the total size header
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded
	
	note, the data wraps around here (wrt px,pz)!

common.map_pillar_set(px, pz, table) @
	sets a full pillar of data
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded
	
	the data is checked before setting,
	and will throw a lua error if it fails.
	
	note, the data wraps around here (wrt px,pz)!
	
	WARNING: You MUST update the side pillars in your code!
	You MUST ALSO fill in the newly-exposed blocks,
	as well as remove the newly-unexposed blocks!
	Otherwise, there WILL be gaps!
	
	WE'RE NOT DOING IT FOR YOU!

gui_create_scene(width, height, shared_rate=1/60)
    Creates a new GUI scene of designated width and height, and a shared update rate in seconds equal to shared_rate.
    
    The GUI system is modelled similarly to the Flash AS3 APIs.
    
    A GUI scene can contain any number of display objects, ordered in a tree structure.
    Each time the GUI is ticked, it processes an event pipeline. An event is a message containing a type and some attached data.
    When an event reaches a display object with a listener of the same type, the listener's callback is called with the event's data.
    
    These events are available:
        GE_DELTA_TIME
            The delta time passed in when listeners are pumped. You can use this to drive tweening over time, for example.
            Callback passes in the dT value.
        GE_SHARED_ALARM
            A tick running at a fixed rate. This is an alternative to delta time for situations where you specifically need a fixed rate,
            for example, an animation that relies on multiplying previous values every step.
            Callback passes in the dT value of the shared alarm timer.
        GE_KEY
            A keypress(up or down) event.
            Callback passes in {key(int), state(bool), modif(int bitmask)}
        GE_BUTTON
            A mapped button press(up or down) event. Use this when you expect the button to be reassignable.
            Callback passes in {key(int), button{name(string), desc(string)}, state(bool), modif(int bitmask)}
        GE_MOUSE
            A mouse movement event.
            Callback passes in {x(number), y(number), dx(number), dy(number)}
        GE_MOUSE_BUTTON
            A mouse button press(up or down).
            Callback passes in {button(int), down(bool)}
