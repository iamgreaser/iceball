work in progress

libraries are "client" and "server"
stuff in both is also put in "common"
note, behaviour might be subtly different

all files must use "/" as a path separator (Unix Master Race)
valid characters are listed here (ignoring the path separator):
-.0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
anything else is invalid and will just be outright rejected

furthermore, no paths will be accepted where a . follows a /
this means that hidden files on unixlikes will not be accepted!

files that are meant to be intercepted should be prefixed with a *
e.g. "*thismap"

maximum path length is 128

stuff that's actually implemented will be marked with an @

lua base library stuff:
	math.* @
	string.* @
	pcall @
	error @
	print @
	loadstring @
	loadfile @
	dofile @
	_G @
	
	nothing else yet
	(TODO: work out what we want to keep,
	 as there's stuff being used that isn't listed here!)
	
	check http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ for more info on these
	
	some notes:
	- dofile(x) = loadfile(x)()
	- loadfile(x) = common.fetch_block("lua", x)
	- common.fetch_block(ftype, x) =
		local obj = common.fetch_start(ftype, x)
		if obj ~= true then return obj end
		while true do
		  local obj = common.fetch_poll()
		  if obj ~= false then return obj end
		  yield()
		end
	- just about every "load" function is based on common.fetch_block

common.base_dir @
	current base directory (minus the "pkg/" bit)
	
	writing to this string will *not* change the base dir,
	so *don't write to it* or else you'll just screw up your own code!

server.port @
	port we are bound to

	there is NO alias to common here! if you want it, do it manually.

common.version = {cmp={w,x,y,a,z},num,str="w.x.ya-z"} @
	current engine version
	
	cmp is for the individual version components
	num is a comparable number (bit count for each: 5,5,7,5,10)
	str is the version as a string

client.renderer @
	current renderer used, "softgm" or "gl"
	there is NO alias to common here! if you want it, do it manually.
	note, as of 0.1.2-11, "softgm" has been removed.

client/server.hook_tick = fn(sec_curtime, sec_delta)->sec_wait @
	sets a hook called every "tick"
	returns a number telling it how long it wants to wait for
	
	"sec_curtime" is the current time elapsed from the start
	"sec_delta" is the time elapsed from the start of the last
	call to the hooked function
	
	setting this to nil will quit your game
	
	NOTE: DO NOT USE COMMON FOR THIS HOOK!
	(only client/server is accepted)

server.hook_file = fn(neth, ftype, fname)->object
	sets a hook to intercept networked file requests
	
	"neth" is the socket handle pertaining to the file request
	
	can return nil to cancel the request
	can return true to perform the default request
	can return a string to load a different file instead
	otherwise, return an object to be serialised
	
	currently supported values for ftype:
	- "icemap"
	
	the rest must be either nil, true, or a string.

client.hook_render = fn() @
	sets a hook called every frame
	
	this is the only place where it is safe to render stuff
	such as models and HUDs and whatnot

client.hook_key = fn(key, state, modif, uni) @
	sets a hook called every time a key changes
	
	state is either true or false
	uni is an index of a unicode character, which is 0 if there is no unicode decoding

client.hook_mouse_button = fn(button, state) @
	sets a hook called every time a mouse button changes
	
	state is either true or false

client.hook_mouse_motion = fn(x, y, dx, dy) @
	sets a hook called every time the mouse is moved
	
	x, y are the current position
	dx, dy are the delta positions
	
	you will probably use the latter pair if the mouse is "locked"
	as x, y are not defined the same on all platforms!

server.hook_connect = fn(neth, addrinfo) @
	sets a hook called every time a client connects
	
	note, neth == true for "local multiplayer" mode
	
	"addrinfo" is a table which may or may not contain:
	- "proto" / "addr": protocol / address used, one of the following:
	  - "local" / nil
	  - "tcp/ip" or "tcp/ip6" / {
		["ip"] = address,
		["host"] = hostname or nil,
		["cport"] = client port,
		["sport"] = server port,
	  }
	
	note, not all of the features are supported.

server.hook_disconnect = fn(neth, server_force, reason) @
	sets a hook called every time a client disconnects
	
	"server_force" is true where the server forces the disconnect

client.mouse_lock_set(state) @
	locks / unlocks the mouse depending on "state"

client.mouse_visible_set(state) @
	shows / hides the mouse depending on "state"

client.mouse_warp(x, y) @
	moves the mouse to x,y

obj = common.fetch_start(ftype, fname)
	initiates a file fetch
	
	"ftype" is one of the following:
	- "lua": lua script
	- "map": map (autodetect)
	- "icemap": map (icemap) - in-memory maps are serialised as THIS.
	- "vxl": map (vxl) - CANNOT SAVE IN THIS FORMAT.
	- "pmf": pmf model
	- "tga": tga image
	- "png": png image - CANNOT SAVE IN THIS FORMAT (yet).
	- "json": json data
	- "wav": wav sound
	- "it": it music module
	- "ttf": ttf font
	- "bin": raw data
	- "ply": Stanford PLY model
	- "log": log data (TODO)
	
	for the server, this just loads the file from the disk.
	
	for the client, all clsave/* stuff is taken from the disk,
	but all other files are downloaded from the server.
	
	returns true if the fetch has started,
	nil if there is an error,
	or the object if this was an immediate load.
	
	if there is already a file in the queue,
	this will return "nil".

obj, csize, usize, amount = common.fetch_poll()
	polls the 
	"obj" is one of the following:
	- "nil" if transfer aborted or nothing is being fetched
	  - in this case, all other fields will be nil
	- "false" if still downloading
	- the object you requested
	  - in this case, another poll will just return nils
	
	"amount" is in the range 0 <= "amount" <= 1,
	and indicates how much is downloaded
	"csize" is the compressed size of the file
	"usize" is the uncompressed size
	
	the two sizes will be nil while unknown.
	
	note, all vxl maps will be converted to icemap before sending.

obj = common.fetch_block(ftype, fname) @
	fetches a file using common.fetch_*
	
	simply returns "nil" on error
	
	if there is already something being fetched,
	it will return "nil", too

client.gfx_alpha_test(enable) @
	(enable ? glEnable : glDisable)(GL_ALPHA_TEST);

	this is reset to true by the start of each frame

client.gfx_clear_color() @
	glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

	clears the screen (or FBO if we're using that)

client.gfx_clear_depth() @
	glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

	clears the depth buffer AKA z buffer

client.gfx_clear_stencil() @
	glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);

	clears the stencil buffer

client.gfx_depth_mask(enable) @
	glDepthMask(enable ? GL_TRUE : GL_FALSE);

	enables (or disables) writing to the depth buffer AKA z buffer
	this is reset to true by the start of each frame

client.gfx_depth_test(enable) @
	(enable ? glEnable : glDisable)(GL_DEPTH_TEST);

	this is reset to true by the start of each frame
	this is ALSO reset to true after calling client.img_blit
	so watch out!

client.gfx_stencil_func(func, ref, mask) @
	glStencilFunc(func, ref, mask)

	func is a string containing one of these:
	- "0" - GL_NEVER
	- "<" - GL_LESS
	- "<=" - GL_LEQUAL
	- ">" - GL_GREATER
	- ">=" - GL_GEQUAL
	- "==" - GL_EQUAL
	- "~=" - GL_NOTEQUAL
	- "1" - GL_ALWAYS

	ref and mask are as per the OpenGL spec

client.gfx_stencil_op(mask) @
	glStencilOp(fail, zfail, zpass);

	mask is a 3-char string,
	each char representing fail, zfail and zpass respectively

	meaning of each char:
	- ; - GL_KEEP
	- 0 - GL_ZERO
	- = - GL_REPLACE
	- + - GL_INCR
	- - - GL_DECR
	- ~ = GL_INVERT

client.gfx_stencil_test(enable) @
	(enable ? glEnable : glDisable)(GL_STENCIL_TEST);

	this is reset to FALSE by the start of each frame

client.gfx_viewport(x, y, width, height) @
	glViewport(x, y, width, height);

	sets up the drawing region
	note, this also corrects the projection matrix

	WARNING: (x,y) denotes the *bottom*-left of the "screen"!

	this is reset to full screen by the start of each frame

tex_units = client.gfx_tex_available() @
	returns the number of texture units available

	note, this will be clamped by the engine limit,
	which is currently 8

	uses GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB
	will eventually use GL_MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS_ARB
	once shader support is in place

success = client.gfx_fbo_available() @
	returns if FBOs are available

fbo = client.fbo_create(w, h, use_stencil) @
	creates a new FBO with color/depth/stencil information
	returns nil on failure

	if use_stencil is set, create a GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT,
	otherwise just a GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT.

	WARNING: this also clears the current FBO status
	so if you're using an FBO, you'll have to call fbo_use again!
	(it does the equivalent of client.fbo_use(nil))
	(why are you creating FBOs once you get around to actually using them anyway?)

	FBO note: the width and height you get will NOT be expanded;
	that is, a 320x200 FBO really IS 320x200,
	rather than 512x256.

client.fbo_use(fbo) @
	uses the given FBO

	"fbo" can be nil, in which case it uses the screen

glver = client.gfx_glsl_available() @
	returns if GLSL shaders are available

	return values:
	- "2.1" if at least GL 2.1
	- "2.0" if GL 2.0
	- nil otherwise

shader, result = client.glsl_create(vertex_src_string, fragment_src_string, attr_array = {}) @
	creates a shader

	attr_array is a list of strings to bind to attributes
	
	returns a shader handle in "shader" on success
	returns nil on failure

	shaders are garbage collected, so watch out!
	
	"result" is just the shader compiler output

client.glsl_use(shader) @
	uses a shader

	pass nil if you want to switch to default GL 1 behaviour
	
	note, fog is disabled while using a shader
	this does NOT mean that the far plane is extended for you!

idx = client.glsl_get_uniform_loc(shader, name) @
	gets the location of a uniform value given a shader

	returns nil on failure

client.glsl_set_uniform_f(uniform_idx, val1[, val2[, val3[, val4]]]) @

	enable built-in voxlap-style side shading
	enabled by default

map = common.map_load(fname, fmt = "auto") @

	use "auto" to autodetect
	
	this will return nil if it fails.

map = common.map_new(lx, ly, lz) @
	creates a new map
	
	note, ly is the *height* of the new map
	
	also all dimensions must be powers of two,
	otherwise this will fail horribly!
	
	this will throw a lua error if it fails.

common.map_free(map) @
	free the given map
	if you don't do this then it's memoryleaktopia
	(plus i'm allowed to kill you)
	
	ALSO DON'T DO THIS TO THE CURRENT "SET" MAP
	
	TODO: clean up all models on game kill

client.map_set_render_format(map, format) @
	defines what render info a map will have
	
	format is as per common.va_make,
	except these are the formats supported:
	- 3v - vertex - must have exactly one
	- 3c - colour - must have at most one
	- 3n - normal - must have at most one
	- 2t - texcoord - must have at most one

	default formats:
	- 3v,3c,3n - gl_shaders enabled
	- 3v,3c - gl_shaders disabled

	you should probably just leave it at the defaults
	when shaders are disabled

client.map_render(map, px, py, pz, tex = nil, afmt = nil, alpha = 1.0) @
	render a map at global position px, py, pz

	see client.va_render_global for the meanings of the other arguments

	NOTE: at the moment it's probably not safe to render two of the same map
	unless the px,py,pz offset is small

common.map_set(map) @
	sets the "current" map to "map"

	these will be nil if there is no map loaded

table = common.map_pillar_get(px, pz) @
	returns a full pillar of data, skipping the total size header
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded
	
	note, the data wraps around here (wrt px,pz)!

common.map_pillar_set(px, pz, table) @
	sets a full pillar of data
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded
	
	the data is checked before setting,
	and will throw a lua error if it fails.
	
	note, the data wraps around here (wrt px,pz)!
	
	WARNING: You MUST update the side pillars in your code!
	You MUST ALSO fill in the newly-exposed blocks,
	as well as remove the newly-unexposed blocks!
	Otherwise, there WILL be gaps!
	
	WE'RE NOT DOING IT FOR YOU!

common.map_mapents_get() @
	gets the MapEnts chunk data (as a hopefully-json string)
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded or no MapEnts chunk

	loads a JSON file and parses it
	
	returns nil on error

common.json_write(fname, value) @
	takes a value and saves it to a file as JSON
	makes the most sense if value is a table
	
	the following types are supported:
	- numbers
	- strings
	- true, false, nil
	- tables
	- arrays
	
	and therefore the following types are NOT supported:
	- functions/closures of ANY sort (C or Lua)
	- userdata (light or otherwise)
	- tables with a metatable (the metatable will be stripped)
	
	and i think that's about it for types really
	
	to tell the difference between tables and arrays it checks for the existence of the key "1"

str = common.net_pack(fmt, ...) @
	packs data into a string

	WARNING: signed/unsigned kinda does matter.
	if you give any values out of range, behaviour is undefined!
	(in other words, ARM behaves differently from x86)

	format is as such:
	b/B = signed/unsigned 8-bit [def 0]
	h/H = signed/unsigned 16-bit [def 0]
	i/I = signed/unsigned 32-bit [def 0]
	f = single-precision 32-bit float [def 0.0]
	d = double-precision 64-bit float [def 0.0]
	z = zero-terminated string [def ""]
	#s = fixed-length string (replace # with a decimal number) [def ""]
	
	throws a lua error if the fmt syntax is invalid.
	
	spews defaults if not enough arguments are provided.

..., remain = common.net_unpack(fmt, str) @
	unpacks data from a string
	
	will attempt to decode from start to end
	
	"remain" is the remainder of the string which was not decoded
	
	returns nil for fields that could not be decoded

success = common.net_send(neth, str, unreliable = false) @
	sends a packet
	
	"neth" is ignored C->S and should be nil
	S->C local multiplayer should set "neth" to "true"

	"unreliable" only makes sense on ENet connections;
	it is ignored for the TCP protocol.
	if "unreliable" is set to "true", we don't care if it arrives or not.

	COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
	before 0.0-50, neth pertains to an ACTUAL socket.
	from 0.0-50 onwards, neth pertains to a CLIENT HANDLE.

	this should not be of any concern to you unless you do Really Stupid Stuff.
	having said that, DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE A ONE-TO-ONE MAPPING TO CLIENT INDICES.

	oh, and as expected, same applies to common.net_recv and every other case you see a neth.

str, neth = common.net_recv() @
	receives a packet
	
	for C->S "neth" is nil
	S->C local multiplayer will result in "neth" being "true"
	
	returns nil, nil if nothing is there
	returns false, nil on the client if the connection was terminated

server.net_kick(neth, reason) @
	kicks a client from the server
	
	fails silently if neth is invalid (but still a plausible parameter),
	or the socket is closed / errors out
	
	throws a lua error for other weird errors.

client.hook_kick = fn(reason) @
	sets a hook called when the player gets kicked

tcpsockfd = common.tcp_connect(hostname, port) @
	creates a raw TCP socket
	returns nil on connection failure
	throws an error in other weird situations

data = common.tcp_recv(tcpsockfd) @
	receives from a TCP socket
	returns an empty string if nothing arrived
	returns false on error, such as disconnection

	WARNING: DO NOT MAKE UP YOUR OWN SOCKFDS!
	DOING THAT CAN REALLY SCREW UP YOUR CONNECTIONS AND WHATNOT.
	SAME WARNING APPLIES TO SENDING.
	
	DO NOT MIX TCPSOCKFDS UP WITH UDPSOCKFDS. IT DOESN'T WORK.

	THAT MEANS DON'T BE A SMARTARSE - LEAVE STDIN/OUT/ERR ALONE.
	NOT EVERYONE DOESN'T USE WINDOWS.

remain = common.tcp_send(tcpsockfd, data) @
	sends data to a TCP socket

	returns the data that wasn't quite sent just yet, which can be an empty string
	returns false on error, such as disconnection

common.tcp_close(tcpsockfd) @
	closes a TCP socket

udpsockfd = common.udp_open() @
	creates a raw UDP socket
	returns nil on socket creation failure
	throws an error in other weird situations

data, host, port = common.udp_recvfrom(udpsockfd) @
	receives from a UDP socket
	returns an empty string + nils if nothing arrived
	returns false on error, such as disconnection

remain = common.udp_sendto(udpsockfd, data, host, port) @
	sends data to a host using a UDP socket

	returns the data that wasn't quite sent just yet, which can be an empty string
	returns false on error, such as disconnection

common.udp_close(udpsockfd) @
	closes a UDP socket

va = common.va_make(vlist, oldva = nil, format = "3v,3c") @
	makes a vertex array of triangles
	vlist is a list of lists of floats in a format like this:
	- {{x,y,z,r,g,b}, ...} ("3v,3c" since 0.2a-1, format arg unsupported there!)
	- {{x,y,z,r,g,b,u,v}, ...} ("3v,3c,2t" since 0.2a-2)
	- {{x,y,z,r,g,b,a}, ...} ("3v,4c" since 0.2.1-1)
	- {{x,y,z,r,g,b,a,u,v}, ...} ("3v,4c,2t" since 0.2.1-1)
	- {{x,y,z,u,v}, ...} ("3v,2t" since 0.2a-2)

	anything else requires 0.2.1-7

	here are the formats you can use:
	- 2v,3v,4v - vertex - must have exactly one
	- 3c,4c - colour - must have at most one
	- 3n - normal - must have at most one
	- 1t,2t,3t,4t - texcoord - must have at most 8
	- 1a,2a,3a,4a - vertex attribute - must have at most 32

	(note for 0.1.2-7: attributes aren't actually supported,
	but they *are* parsed. wait for shader support before using them!)

	if you don't follow your given format this can throw an error,
	so WATCH OUT.

	oldva, when set, replaces an existing VA with new data,
	and then this function will (theoretically) return oldva.

client.va_render_global(va, px, py, pz, ry, rx, ry2, scale, tex = nil, afmt = nil, alpha = 1.0) @
	draws a vertex array relative to the world

	tex must be a power-of-two texture, or nil,
	or a list of either of those two

	current max for a texture list is 8

	afmt consists of two characters, or is nil
	note, if afmt is nil, blending is disabled!
	(i.e. it behaves like you used "10")

	first character defines source from one of these: 01CRahAHs
	second character defines dest from one of these: 01crahAH

	meanings of each char:
	- sd 0 = GL_ZERO
	- sd 1 = GL_ONE
	- .d c = GL_SRC_COLOR
	- s. C = GL_DST_COLOR
	- .d r = GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR
	- s. R = GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR
	- sd a = GL_SRC_ALPHA
	- sd A = GL_DST_ALPHA
	- sd h = GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
	- sd H = GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA
	- s. s = GL_SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE
	
	useful blend modes:
	- additive: "11"
	- multiplicative: "C0" (?)
	- translucent: "ah"

	note, "alpha" only works with VAs that don't provide a colour

client.va_render_local(va, px, py, pz, ry, rx, ry2, scale, tex = nil, afmt = nil, alpha = 1.0) @
	draws a vertex array relative to the camera
